<br />

I am a Dev & UX Accessibility Specialist at <a href="https://atos.net/en/">Atos</a>. I love to **learn** about new technology, **connect** with people around the world and **help** others get into tech as well.

I am <a href="https://developers.google.com/community/experts">Google Developer Expert</a> for Web Development.

I am the founder of <a href="https://accessibilityfirst.at/">Accessibility First</a>, where I share articles, tutorials and more about web accessibility in UX Design, Web Development, Testing and more. I give talks and attend discussions about accessibility and how to get into tech as a selftaught developer.

**Some doors have to be closed to make room for something new.**
